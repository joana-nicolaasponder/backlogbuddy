# backlog-buddy
TEST
Hello, welcome to my personal project. This is something I'm building as I learn, so be patient :) This idea is close to my heart because I purchase way too many video games and never actually play or finish them. It's awful. I have a very long long list of games in my  backlog. And I thought, it would be cool if I could get a game recommended to me that I already own, in order to scratch the itch that I might be feeling. Ideally, this will help me save money in the long run, and help me play the games in the backlog. 

## Core Functionality and Goals of the Backlog Buddy App

The Backlog Buddy app aims to provide users with a comprehensive solution for managing their video game backlog. Its core functionality includes:

- Game Backlog Management: Users can add and categorize video games they own but have not yet played or completed, creating a personalized backlog.

- Game Recommendation: The app offers game recommendations based on user-defined criteria such as genre, mood, or gameplay preferences. This helps users discover which game in their backlog matches their current gaming desires.

- Game Information Retrieval: Users can access detailed information about each game in their backlog, including title, genre, release date, and platform.

- User Authentication (Optional): Optionally, the app can support user registration and authentication to enable personalized backlog management.

## The primary goals of the Backlog Buddy app are to:

- Help users keep track of their unplayed games, reducing the chance of forgetting about titles in their collection.

- Assist users in finding the perfect game from their backlog to match their current gaming preferences, reducing the temptation to purchase new games unnecessarily.

- Provide a user-friendly and visually appealing interface for easy interaction.

- Optionally, enhance the user experience through authentication, enabling features like personalized recommendations.

## By achieving these goals, the Backlog Buddy app aims to streamline the gaming experience for users, optimizing their enjoyment of their existing game library and encouraging thoughtful game selection.
